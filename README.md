ASP.NET Core is used in this project to provide a strong backend for the train ticket reservation system, while React.js is used to create a modern and user-friendly frontend. MongoDB is used as the data store, and all of this is nicely integrated. This project has been properly created to meet the requirements of the EAD module assignment. In order to provide a travel experience, we have executed five key features within its framework: User Management, Traveler Management, Train Management, Schedule Management, and Reservation Management.
Here, we have integrated several unique features inside our project and used JWT authentication and password encryption.Here are a few of the user interfaces we've put in place.
